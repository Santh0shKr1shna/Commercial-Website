Iâ€™ve designed a website for an air and space museum which presents you with a spectacular display of events and visuals proving this museum is 
one piece of art not to be missed.

This website is basically built on HTML 5 and designed using CSS 3 mark-ups. Decentralised stylesheets with versatile usage provide the website a lot of options 
on the creative side.Nearly, all major tags in html are used to ensure the site stays future and fool proof.

In addition, website has advanced CSS concepts implemented to give edge over animated transition effects. Extra design methods like flexbox, transform, translate has been used.
