                    <span class="para">It</span> was one cold evening when, the youngest of the family, Stewie, came running to his 
                    father for the daily dose of astronaut stories that he told him everyday since his retirement from NASA in his 
                    early 40's. Peter Griffin, served the nation at NASA from 1968 to 1993 in various fields of study and exploration.
                    Thanks to his children, Stewie, Chris and Megan all of his instruments, collectibles and video tapes are been 
                    carefully preserved since his death at 2012.<br>In memory of this geatest feats the brothers started a fund and 
                    the oundation for The Peter Griffin Aeronautical Museum that is now, one of the best aeronauticl museum today.<br><br>
                    <span style="margin-left: 50px; margin-left: 50px;"><i>"The Griffin's is an ornamental collection of all aeronautical 
                        events in the history. The dedication on this projest is highly appreciated"</i><br></span>

                    <br><br>This museum also represents it's deepest gratitude to Peter's friends Joe Swanson, Glenn Quagumire, 
                    Cleveland Brown for making this dream possible. In his autobiography Peter writes, "My buddies are the best. 
                    They're pepper to my coffee, fork to my soup and like that lenskart coupon in phonepe app." his words not mine. And 
                    also he spent an entire chapter saying how important were his friends in his life. They playes a small yet significant
                    part in his life, they held his back when in the lows. He also mentioned how his life was before entering NASA.
                    He used work in a brewery in a small town named Quahog, Rhode island. His life story still stands as an inspiration for millions.  
                    He once bought lottery tickets worth 10 grand. And unexpectedly he won a whole 1.5 millions and yet gone backrupt
                    the same year. After this was when he goes to NASA comes.<br><br>
                    This museum documented many major explorations and satelite launches. Get to know about the behind the scenes 
                    moment beore an shuttle launch and get ready to be amused by the precision of instuments used in a satelite or in a 
                    telescope. Soon after the funding started growing, it got into the attention of potential doners also interested in aeronautics
                    we first reused it being a dedicated museum for space. But they hired Italian mafia, thus this is a Aeronautical Museum now
                    Air and Space museum.<br>
